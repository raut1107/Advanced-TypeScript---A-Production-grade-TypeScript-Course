🟣 Understanding the never Type as an Empty Union in TypeScript

In TypeScript, never is a special type that represents an empty union —
it doesn’t contain any values at all.

🔍 Recap — never in Conditional Types

Previously, we learned that using never on the left-hand side of an extends keyword in a conditional type always results in never.

Let’s revisit that with an example 👇

🧩 Example: Basic Conditional Type
type CheckAnswer<A> = A extends 50 ? true : false;


If we test this with a few values:

type Result1 = CheckAnswer<50>;   // ✅ true
type Result2 = CheckAnswer<30>;   // ❌ false


Everything seems normal —
if A is 50, we get true, otherwise false.

⚠️ Now What Happens with never?

Let’s try passing never:

type Result3 = CheckAnswer<never>;   // 🤔 What do we get?


Surprisingly, instead of false, we get:

type Result3 = never;

🧠 Why Does This Happen?

Since never is an empty union, there is nothing to distribute over.
Think of it like trying to map over an empty array in JavaScript —
you’ll simply get an empty array back because there’s nothing to process.

💡 Analogy in JavaScript

Here’s the equivalent behavior in JavaScript:

const arr = [];
const result = arr.map(x => x * 2);
console.log(result); // []


Because there’s nothing inside arr, the result is just an empty array.

🔸 Conceptual Parallel
TypeScript Concept	JavaScript Analogy	Result
never (empty union)	[] (empty array)	Nothing to operate on
Conditional type applied to never	Function mapped over empty array	Returns never / []
🧩 Key Takeaway

When you run a conditional type on never, it’s like trying to apply a function to each element of an empty array.
There are no elements to apply it to —
so the result is simply never.

✅ In short:

The never type behaves like an empty set — it represents nothing, and any operation over it results in nothing.
